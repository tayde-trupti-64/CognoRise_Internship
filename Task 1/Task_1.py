Task: Analyze the unemployment rate in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Step 1: Data Preparation

Load the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india/data
Convert the "Date" column to datetime format using pandas' to_datetime() function
Filter the data to only include rows where the date is after March 2020 (to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic period)
Step 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis

Calculate the average unemployment rate for the selected period (after March 2020)
Plot the unemployment rate over time using a line chart or area chart
Identify any notable trends or patterns in the unemployment rate during this period
Step 3: Visualize and Summarize Results

Create a simple summary table or report highlighting the key findings:
Average unemployment rate during the pandemic period
Any notable changes or trends in the unemployment rate over time
A brief conclusion or interpretation of the results
Here's some sample Python code to get you started:

CopyReplit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('unemployment_in_india.csv')

# Convert date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Filter data to only include rows after March 2020
df = df[df['Date'] >= '2020-03-01']

# Calculate average unemployment rate
avg_unemployment_rate = df['Unemployment Rate'].mean()

# Plot unemployment rate over time
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Unemployment Rate'])
plt.title('Unemployment Rate in India during COVID-19 Pandemic')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Unemployment Rate (%)')
plt.show()

# Create summary table or report
print(f'Average unemployment rate during pandemic period: {avg_unemployment_rate:.2f}%')

import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('unemployment_data.csv')

# Convert date column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Split data into training and testing sets
train_df, test_df = df.split(test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Calculate summary statistics for each column
print(df.describe())

# Visualize distribution of unemployment rate
sns.distplot(df['Unemployment Rate (%)'])

# Calculate average unemployment rate across all states
avg_unemployment_rate = df['Unemployment Rate (%)'].mean()
print(f'Average Unemployment Rate: {avg_unemployment_rate:.2f}%')

# Plot average unemployment rate over time
plt.plot(df['Date'], df['Unemployment Rate (%)'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Unemployment Rate (%)')
plt.title('Average Unemployment Rate Over Time')
plt.show()

# Identify states with highest and lowest unemployment rates
highest_unemployment_rate = df['Unemployment Rate (%)'].max()
lowest_unemployment_rate = df['Unemployment Rate (%)'].min()
print(f'Highest Unemployment Rate: {highest_unemployment_rate:.2f}%')
print(f'Lowest Unemployment Rate: {lowest_unemployment_rate:.2f}%')

# Calculate correlation between unemployment rate and other variables
correlation_matrix = df.corr()

print(correlation_matrix)



Step 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis

Calculate the average unemployment rate for the selected period (after March 2020)
Plot the unemployment rate over time using a line chart or area chart
Identify any notable trends or patterns in the unemployment rate during this period
